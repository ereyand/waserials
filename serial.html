<h1>Theodore Robert Cowell</h1>
<p>Mr. Cowell is most infamously known as Ted Bundy, the most prolific serial killer in American history. Ted Bundy started killing in Washington State but then progressed down the west coast of the country - Oregon, California, Idaho, Utah, Colorado and ultimately Florida. Bundy was executed in the Florida State Prison on January 24, 1989.</p>
<h2>Victimology</h2>
<p>Bundy targeted women but he specifically targeted white females who were around college age-15 to 25 years old. But, he was careful enough to not come into contact with anyone associated with him. It is believed that majority of the victims were surrogates for the one that rejected him Stephnie Brooks, a female with long strigh hair that is parted in the middle. Psychoogists believe that this rejection is what triggered the killing spree. Yet, what is known about all the victims is that they were young and beautiful.</p>
<h2>Modus Operandi, M.O</h2>
<p>Cowell always killed in an organized manner by planning for noise and DNA, he did this by learning of law enforcement procedure. Ted demonstrated this by killed his first 20 victims in seperate jurisdictions so that law enforcement would not connect the cases. Additionally, he had the ability to blend in by changing his appearance where ever he went. Yet, most significantly he used charm and charisma to get victims. Bundy's M.O was usually blunt force trauma (striking victims in the head) or strangulation. As Bundy killed, he became more sophisicated and killed in a careful manner.
