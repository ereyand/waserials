<h1 style= "color: black;">Fun Facts</h1>
<p>Gary Ridgway is the person convicted the most for killing.</p>
<p>Gary Rigway received his name of "Green River Killer" due to the places he would dump his victims' bodies that were forest areas/places with a lot of greenery such as Green River. This was his first dumping ground.</p>
<p>Ridgway is a graduate of Tyee High School in Seatac, Washington.</p>

<h1>Gary Ridgway</h1>
<p>Gary Ridgway known as the Green River Killer was convicted for 49 murders of teenage girls and women between the 1980s ad 1990s in Washington state.</p>
<h2>Victimology</h2>
<p>Women; teenagers and older. He targeted sex workers and other high risk women such as runaway girls</p>
<h2>Modus Operandi, M.O</h2>
<p>He strangled his victims; most often by hand but there have been ligitare marks on some victims meaning that he used some sort of garrot. He would then dump their body in forest areas/places with a lot of greenery such as the Green River where he dumped his first five victims hence his name.</p>
<h2>How Technological Advances in the Field of Forensic Science Lead to Gary Ridgway's Capture.</h3>
<p>Gary Ridgway ramained al large for decades, dropping bodies as years went by. By the early 1990s, he had stopped killing yet the police had his DNA that they recovered from four of his victims. The DNA analysis is what ultimately lead to his capture and his confession for killing so many women. This DNA analysis ultimately lead to his plea bargain where police found the location of victims' bodies. From semen to saliva, the analysis of these samples was what allowed agents to capture the suspect.</p>
<p>A forensic scientist was also able to match microscopic spray paint samples found on three victims to the brand used by the Kenworth factory. The same factory Gary Ridgway was employeed at.</p>
